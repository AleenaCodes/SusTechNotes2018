## Supply Chain Management

There are several key players in the supply chain

- Buyer - people who find new products and negotiate to get them onto shelves
- QA/Technologists - set standards internally
- Auditors - both internal and external

Perceptions of stakeholders are important, there are some dangers from the perspective of European companies

- Encouraging the Potempkin effect - you need to see the reality of the suppliers practices rather than the nicely dressed version they would show the buyer
- Being accused of Neo-Colonialism - being seen as changing cultural practices for their suppliers, have to be sensitive


## Ethical Trading Initiative

- The ETI was formed 20 years ago
- There was a rise in green consumers
- There were lots offshore supply chains forming without many workers rights
- Some businesses began to look at their supply chains to try and be more ethical
	- Fairtrade - began with tea and coffee and then expanded
	- The Body Shop - became big with their responsibly-sourced products
	- Big supermarkets realised they didn't have one-on-one relationships with suppliers
- Companies 'group-funded' auditors to share the same standard

### How it Works

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AwVHVLCdo0qHR8_4-QyjlNvtZ9U-wYYj8eTvWELMYRYvD1PF-oV0q8TismC6-B4MuBZdHAQbvMOe)
There are 3 players

- Businesses - wanted better supply chains
- NGOs - applied pressure
- Trade Unions - bought in by government

These combined to make the ETI

### ETI Base Code

Some rules were instated for supply chains

- Employment is freely chosen
- Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
- Working conditions are safe and hygeinic
- Child labour shall not be used
- Living wages are paid
- Working hours are not excessive
- No discrimination is practised
- Regaulr employment is provided
- No harsh or inhuman treatment is allowed
- The provisions of this code constitute minimum standard, companies can exceed these

However many of things aren't very simple e.g. What age is a child? What are excessive working hours? etc.

### ETI Membership

To sign up to the ETI -

- Demonstrate a clear commitment to ethical trade
- Integrate ethical trade into their core business practices
- Drive year-on-year improvements to working conditions
- Support suppliers to improve working conditions, e.g. through advice and training
- Report openly and accurately about their activities

### Report Contents

Companies found reporting hardest - many were reluctant to say they'd failed at anything and this had to be encouraged

The report had to include -

- Who is driving the company's ethical trade strategy
- How much money they've spent on ethical trade activities
- What training have they given to staff and suppliers
- What progress have they made in integrating ethical trade into their business practices
- How they assess working conditions at their suppliers' worksites
- How they ensure that any improvements requested from suppliers have been made, and these changes in workers' conditions are recorded


### Early Learning Points

In practice implementing these things requires a lot of flexibility

- Political issues between people in a region
- Finding an independent arbiter who can monitor things in your absence
- Understanding which practices were ethical and unethical

### Membership Benefits to Businesses

- Increased working with suppliers meant more productive relationships - better long-term deals
- Provides good evidence against campaigns against the company, and campaigners tend to focus on non-engaged companies
- Having a poor reputation on these issues can discourage the best talent from joining the company, especially young people

## Conflict Free Mineral Sourcing Initiative

- There are rising concerns around where metals in products come from e.g. mobiles
- US legislation around this - requires manufacturers to report use of conflict minerals
- The Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative has been developted- focused around Tantalum, Tin, Tungsten and Gold - specifically around the smelters - the earliest point

Members of the CFI have to

- Establish strong company management systems
- Identify and assess risk in the supply chain
- Design and implement a strategy to respone to identified risks
- Carry out independent 3rd-party audit of supply chains
- Report on their supply chain due diligence

## Modern Slavery Act

An act in 2015 requires that companies with turnover >Â£36million have to issue a statement, focussed around

- Policies related to anti-slavery
- Due diligence process in relation to supply chain
- High risk areas and mitigation measures are adopted

## Public Services (Social Value) Act

An act in January 2013 requires public bodies to consider choosing service providers based on their social value, and not cost alone
