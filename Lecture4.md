## Dunphy's levels of engagement (cont.)

### Strategic Proactivity

- Company believes that sustainability issues are important from strategic perspective - give them a competitive advantage
- Elite in the company pay attention to it
- Active attempt to redesign existing products to reduce environmental impacts
- See sustainability in two ways
	- Competitive advantage
	- Potential risk - don't want prodcuts to become harder to sell in the future
- Expertise moves - centre of action is now to those who set the direction of the company - business strategy, R&D, board level
	- More companies these days expect to have at least some people in R&D teams to have a deep understanding of sustainbality

#### Examples

- Tesla
	- Company encouraging transformation of industry, in a way that also makes them money
	- Old-guard will respond by taking a similar approach
- DEC 
	- First company to manufacture integrated circuits without the use of lead
	- Authorities wanted to phase out lead in manufacturing but companies were saying they didn't have the equipment to do so
	- DEC were able to get legislation passed and then licence their technology to other people - profiting from this

### The Sustaining Corporation

- Working for a sustainable world is a priority
- Actively promote sustainability values in business, and in society
- Caveats
	- A company is not monolithic - different subcultures within the company
	- Companies can be at different levels fo different issues
	- Attitude can move down as well as up - e.g. in recession sustainability can be less of a priority

## How do sustainability factors become business drivers?

### Sustainability factors

The following are sustainability factors, which can affect businesses in different ways

- Fresh water depletion
- Climate change
- Non-renewable resource depletion
- Topsoil erosion/depletion
- Deforestation
- Peak oil
- Biodiversity loss
- Pollution (air, water, land)

What has this got to do with business?

- Governments want to reduce the external negative effects of business and harness the private sector to tackle sustainability problem
- Sustainability changes can have a direct impact on the market
- Other stakeholders' action can have an effect on the market

### Government Levers

- Government can pass laws
- This is slow, they often trqy to use other methods, as passing laws can take a while

### Market-Based Policy Interventions

- Try to create a market to create environmental good
- Decide how much pollution can you emit - then hand out to emitters and then can use, sell, buy

### Market Impacts

- When environmental issues directly impact the market
- Directly impacted by ecosystem depletion e.g. farming
- Supply monopolies and resource conflicts
- Customer demand

### Price Signals

- As supply reduces and demand increases - prices go up

### End Customer

- A significant amount of end customers are concerned with sustainability
- There are niche markets that are growing-  often single issue-based - e.g. Fairtrade
- People trust NGOs over Government and Producers

### Business Customers - Retailers

- Try to be sustainable to be more accepted by customers
- Companies may make products that cost more but are sustainably made

### Business Customers - Producers

- Companies drive requirements down the supply chain - encforce standards in suppliers

### Public Sector Customers

- Public sector buys a lot as a market
- Can require a level of performance before buying things

### Actions of Other Stakeholders

- Investors may ask companies to do things
- NGOs etc. may lobby against you

### Institutional Shareholders and Analysts

- They asses how well companies are preparing for the impact of climate change, and looking for 'winners and losers'
- Some institutional shareholders (e.g. insurance companies, pension funds etc.) don't want the market to collapse because of climate change

### Possible Approaches

Reactive approach -

- Respond to drivers as they manifest
- Advantage - don't spend as much on sustainability now
- Disadvantage - might be caught off guard, risk of green-washing - doing something you think is green but not really understanding it

Strategic proactivity -

- Embed sustainability into strategic thinking
- Helps to identify potential business advantage from 'taking the high ground'
- Reduces risk - especially as things move fast now
- But more up-front cost
