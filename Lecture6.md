## The Challenge of Supply

- At the end of the last century nuclear came from gas, oil, nuclear
- We became worried about acid rain, reducing supplies of oil and gas, increasing prices, climate change and aging infrastructure
- Electricity consumption has been decreasing
- More generation is needed as demand is expected to increase
- New generation is coming from renewables, but it's intermittent - we don't exactly know when they will produce, can only predict
- The UK grid is being invigorated
- There may be massive amounts of baseload to sell if nuclear takes off
- There are more uses for electricity - may need 3x as much if things like transport and heating becoming electric
- Might cost £200 billion

### How this translates to customers

- There are incentives to use outside of peak times - low prices
- There are high prices during peaks - maybe compulsion to balance from the consumer perspective is coming

The charge (£200 billion) to change the grid is coming from somewhere

- Transmission uses of system and distribution use of system charges
- Capacity charges - get charged when use above this
- TRIADs - tries to manage consumption at peak hours
	- 3/4 times a year
	- Communicated in advance
- CCL - climate change levy - tax on individuals
- VAT
- CRC - carbon reduction commitment - institutions have to pay if produce more carbon
- Contract for Difference - funding for new local sources of electricity

## Energy Efficiency - Cheaper than Generation

For the university -

- Voltage optimisation
	- Reduce voltage across the entire estate
	- Cost ~£1million
	- Saves ~£300k a year
- Reboilering
	- University has a tendency to replace boilers with similar models
	- Most of them were 7x bigger than they needed to be
	- Don't need to purchase for the worst case scenario - should look at more realistic use
	- Can anticipate weather in advance and work around it now - no need to assume will have to heat from -10C
- Insulation
- Lighting controls
- HVAC
- Control - especially of electrically heated halls
- Difficult estate - e.g. listed buildings
	- Can't change windows in listed buildings
	- Can work around this - e.g. using Mastik around windows to reduce draughts

## Pros and cons of generations

- Intermittent - can't say for sure when production will happen
- Using what you generate
- How can you storage broker this?

## Storage

- Complexity of demand these days - can't predict peaks very much and many production methods 'halfway down' the production pipeline
- Energy storage systems manage our power supply to create a more resilient energy infrastructure and bring cost savings to utilities and consumers
- Want to store energy when it's cheap/plentiful and discharge it when it's expensive and scarce
- Storage can be grid of local level

<br>

- In the UK - have enough power, but struggle to meet peaks
- Need to balance this out

## Electric Vehicles - Challenges

- Over 100,000 hybrid and pure EV's on the UK roads
- Western Power Distribution predicted a million by the end of the decade
- WPD suggest than an EV travelling 10,000 miles a year could double the energy consumption of the home it charges from

### Vehicles to Grid

- Could use electric cards a 'power station'
- 90% of cars are parked at any one time
- Energy could be fed back into the grid to help supply energy at times of peak demand
- Will need '2-way' chargers, 'smart metering' and a power agreement
- The value is in demand maangement and not the amount of power delivered

## Smart Systems

- Could being implementing smart systems in homes
- e.g. want the wash done within the next 10 hours but don't care when - could automatically do it when it's advantageous for the grid, and hence cheaper for you

### The Smart Grid

![smart_grid](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VMOXXG18PrujTC4UZeNvbh8TWomB2V1UP7l8SmGROOxE382OZFSbpb6cwkCFQYbh2n08R5J7C8K1)
- Pre-empt demand and work for it
	- e.g. fill water tanks before evening rush

### How will this affect us

- Need to act to renew the grid
- This will lead to increasing prices
- Demand management will increase and be more invasive
- Increasingly affect smaller consumers and those who don't adapt

Tools to mitigate impact

- Conservation and efficiency
- Greater automation and control
- Storage

Outcome

- Lower CO2
- Greater independence and fuel security in the UK
