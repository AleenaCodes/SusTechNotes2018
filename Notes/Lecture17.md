## Why is Energy Use Important?

- There are associated carbon emissions
- There is a reduced supply and increasec demand over time

Today we'll be looking technological innovations and business drivers interweave, particularly in terms of government asks on companies

Business drivers -

- Mandatory consumer energy efficiency labelling - EU
- Voluntary standards - EnergyStar
- Legislation - EuP, Stand by Power

## Does Economics Drive Efficiency

- Electricity costs, and prices are going up
- So it's in the consumer's interest to buy more energy-efficiency products
- Manufacturer's should invest in energy efficient - accept 'total cost of ownership'
	- And consumers would pay more for a product because of energy cost savings in its lifetime
- However this doesn't happen in practice - people don't know/want to calculate this and just buy cheaper things
- Companies may have different departments who deal with equipment and paying for electricity bills
- Companes are discourages from investing in efficient technology due to 'first mover advantage'

## Responding to Market Failure

- This is a 'market failure' - players aren't reacting ideally and thus the problems around energy efficiency are not being worked on properly
- Intervention is needed to prevent/mitigate market failure
- 'Economically rational' interventions are ones which take the market back towards the economic ideal
- And there may be policy reasons for going beyond this ideal
	- e.g. future resilience, energy security

Some possible interventions

- Make it simpler for customers - ecolabelling
- Legislate to impose requirements e.g. the EuP directive
- Encourage collective action by companies e.g. Climate Savers Computing Initiative

## Energy Labelling

An energy label tries to give an estimate of how efficient a product is

- Measures energy/power that a product should use - 'reference power consumption'
- Then compare the actual power to reference power and gives a letter grade

### Improving Efficiency with Technology

Different technologies have been brought in over time to increase energy efficiency
e.g. CRT -> Plasma -> LCA -> OLED

### Does it work?

Yes, but likely to be more down to psychology than economics -

- Raises awareness of energy issues in customers
- Simple to understand
- Makes it easier to incorproate energy efficiency in a purchase
- Manufacturers are encourage to be greener - red labels look bad for them
- Some retailers choose to only stock products above a certain grade

## The Rebound Effect

- As energy efficency increases, consumers will save money on electricity bills
- As a result people will be happy using more electricity - thus get rid of some of the effects of this
- The same innovations which improve energy efficiency also result in smaller, cheaper, faster computers and hence people have begun using more computing over time
