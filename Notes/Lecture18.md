## What is eWaste?

- Any appliance with an electric power supply (definition by OECD)
- This includes both integrated power supply and batteries

## What's different about eWaste?

- It is the most toxic domestic waste stream
- It contains elements such as lead, cadmium, mercury
- It contains flame retardants, which release dioxins if burnt, although these are being phased out
- It is the most valuable domestic waste - it contains substances such as gold, silver, platinum, rare earth metals, reusable components etc.
- In theory, it is possible to recover 90% of base metals and 97% of precious metals that are used in electronic goods

## Value Proposition

As a result of all of the above, there's an industry around the disposal or eWaste - there are three parts to it -

- Compliance
	- Ensuring laws around eWaste are met
	- Companies can offer a service where they take care of disposal
- Risk mitigation
	- Ensure you don't unexpectedly become a victim of bad PR around eWaste
- Value recovery
	- Things of value that are recovered from you eWaste can either be returned to you, or sold and offset against your disposal bill

## eWaste Recycling Process

- Collection - need a way of getting things back from owners
	- Separated at point-of-collection by owner
	- Take-back schemes at point-of-sale e.g. collecting old fridge when delivering new
	- Separation out of other refuse streams
- Dismantling
	- Remove hazardous, re-usable and high-value components by hand
	- Sort into different streams if necessary
	- Coarse crushing or hand picking are options
- Pre-processing
	- Shredding e.g. circuit boards
	- Further automated sorting into separate streams
- End-processing
	- Metal recovery
	- Ferrous fractions go to steel plans, aluminium fractions to aluminium smelters
	- PCBs og to integrated metal smelters
	- The smelting processes burns impurities (e.g. plastic paint) which can result in the formation of toxis VOCs and dioxins
		- Hence 'off gas control equipment' is essential
	- Hydrometallurgy - solvents are used to dissolve key metals and leach them from the substrate

## Processing Costs

- Currently the cost of safely processing eWaste is greater than the value of the metals recovered
	- So eWaste is a liability
- The cost is traditionally borner by municipal authorities, who stuck it in a dump and tried to control leaching
- This is no longer considered acceptable

## Extended Producer Responsibility

- Since authorities aren't very good with dealing with eWaste, the idea of manufacturer responsibility has been introduced
- The responsibility now extends beyond manufacture and sale, and also covers take back, recycling and final disposal

Goals of EPR -

- Source reduction
- Waste prevention and improved management of hazardous waste
- Design of more environmentally compatible products
- Closure of material loops, to promote sustainable development

### Individual Producer Responsibility

- The specific company is responsible for the takeback and reuse/recycling of their own equipment
- Advantages
	- Provides a direct economic incentive to companes to design with end-of-life in mind
	- e.g. designing to be easily disassembled
- Disadvantages
	- Harder to collect and route eWaste separately for each company
	- No process for dealing with eWaste belonging to companies that no longer exist

### Sectoral Producer Responsibility

- The sector is responsible as a whole as opposed to individual companies
- At the start of the scheme, producers pay into a pot based on their current market share
	- This is used to process historical eWaste
- Then producers pay a tariff into the pot for goods they manufacture
- Goods are collected through disposal sites and point-of-sale
- End-of-life processors claim from the pot as goods come to them

## The WEEE directive

- An EU directive passed in 2002, and transposed into national laws in 2003-06
- Aims to impose sectoral responsibility for existing goods, and individual producer responsbility for subsequent sale of goods
- However most EU countries found it difficult to put into place, so opted to use a sectoral responsibility approach for everything
	- NGOs and some companies wanted individual approach, for example if the company has a cheaper process they can use for their own goods

## The Reduction of Hazardous Substances Directive

- WEEE thinks of the end of the lifecycle, RoHS thinks of the early design
- Thinks of 'managing the system' as opposed to singular points
- Aims to make it easier and cheaper to safely recycle eWaste
- Aims to reduce the impact of eWaste that is improperly disposed
- Places limits on the concentration of a number of controlled toxic substances e.g. lead, mercury, cadmium, haxavalent etc.
- Maximum permitted concentration of $0.1\%$ to any single substance that could be theoretically separated manually

## The Basel Convention

- Entered in 1992
- Aims to control the movement of hazardous waste between countries, particularly from more developed to less developed countries
- Requires 'prior informed consent' by the receiving nation
- Companies still try to subvert this by calling it a 'donation'
- More reputable exporters try to enforce a rigirous 'chain of custody' to ensure products are working when they are donated
