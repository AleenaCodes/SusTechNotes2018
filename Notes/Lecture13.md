# Lecture 13 - 14/11/18

## Exam

- Exam has 1 part Life Cycle Assessment
	- Next 4 lectures
	- Problem sheet 2 covers this
	- Mathematically simple but need to understand reasons behind what you're doing
	- Recent past papers also cover it
- Exam part 2 is everything else (not including Greening with ICT which is in  Coursework)

## Intro - LCA

- When designing something you have to make different tradeoffs
	- How much will it cost?
	- How long will it take to make?
	- How easy is it to make?
	- What will be the environmental impact?
	- Etc.
- LCA is something that allows people to quantify environmental impacts over a product's whole life
- It means that designers can integrate environmental factors into their decision-making
- Considers impact from 'cradle to grave'
- We're looking at process-based LCA today
	- Involves making a process model of the entire life of a product and quantify that whole process

Science and engineering is political - LCA results can affect public perception and government policy so transparency and peer review of them is essential

This is a simplified LCA

## Parts of an LCA

An LCA has 4 components

- Goal and Scope
	- Why the LCA is being done
	- What the scope is
- Inventory Analysis
	- Build a flow model of the overall system
	- Provide data of the input (raw materials) and output (waste) that is involved
- Impact Assessment
	- Use environmental/chemical techniques to quantify impact
- Interpretation
	- Give recommendations with regards to the original goal

### Goal and Scope

Some examples of questions being asked - what is the carbon footprint of an iPad Pro, what should our research teams focus on to reduce environmental impact of our product? etc.

The Goal is structured as follows -

- Intended Application - what you'll do with the LCA
- Purpose  - why you're conducting it
- Target Audience - who is this for? e.g. public, clients, corporate, research, business risk analysis, design team, assessors etc.
- Methods, Assumptions, Limitations - type of LCA
- Initiator/funder of study - being transparent about this is important

Decisions about the scope have a signifcant impact on the final results

- Function unit - e.g. a 75g bag of crisps, 1 nappy change etc.
	- This determined the 'reference flow' - a precise quantification of the functional unit
- System boundaries - what are the 'edges' of the system
	- What is 'inside' and 'outside' the analysis - may choose to ignore something
	- What is an input variable
	- The more inside the system the more accurate it'll be more but the more time-consuming the LCA will be
	- Can you use other people's research on 'the edge' to avoid modelling them again
	- e.g. when looking at an iPad may include the charging electricity, materials used, lifetime, recycling, and disregard the lorry transport, marketing, design etc.
- Description of data categories to be used
- Criteria for inclusion of inputs/outputs
- Data quality requirements
- Impact categories - which impact(s) are being assessed
	- Global warming potential
	- Ozone depletion
	- Human toxicology
	- Ecotoxicology
	- Photo oxidant formation
	- Acidification
	- Ionising radiation
	- Land use
	- May have a tradeoff between these
- Methods for handling multi-functionality and allocation
- Key assumptions and limitations
- Critical review

### Types of LCA

- Account LCA - What is the total figure?
- Change Oriented LCA - What will be the impact of making a change in a system?
- Screening LCA - simplified by making assumptions - collecting data is intensive so it can be more efficient to do this
- Complete LCA - don't make any assumptions
