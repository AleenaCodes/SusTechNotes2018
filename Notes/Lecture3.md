## Dryzek's Model (cont.)

### Imaginative and Radical - Green Radicalism

- Need to change society in a big way
	- Modernist society is the key cause of the problem, needs to be radically rethought
	- Need to change attitudes

Two main view - 

- Green consciousness - change the way we experience the world
- Green politics - change the way we organise the world

#### Green Consciousness

- Nature has value in its own right, regardless of value to humanity
- Need to live more in harmony with nature than we do now
- Emotional rather than rational decision - often spoken about in emotional terms
- Hierarchies has come out of modernism - should live in less hierarchical society - closer to nature
- Stories can invoke sense of wonder in the world and resonate with people

#### Green Politics

- Modern indsutrialist system is the cause of our environmental problems - need a radical structural change - need to fight
- Found in green parties but also more radical left
- Spiritualism won't help society - need to transform society
	- Need a bottom-up people's movement
	- Make society more equal
	- Make us more harmonious with nature
- Politics should be more decentralised so people can become more aware and engaged
- All humanity is equal - we prioritise competition too much, need systems encouraging collaboration
- People are multifaceted - political structures should bring out benign motivations in us
- Rational argument and rhetoric

### Conclusion

- Discourses influence the way we think and talk about environmental problems
- Dryzek categorises discourse into four classes

## Sustainability and business

We'll look at

- Different corporate attitudes to sustainability
- Business drivers that emerge from sustainability factors, and how they impact corporations

## Dunphy's levels of engagement

Important model of how companies think about sustainability, the idea is that these are successive stages

|Stage|Description|
|:----|:----|
|Exploit|Rejection|
|Avoid|Non-responsiveness|
|Limit|Compliance|
|Invest|Eco-efficiency|
|Compete|Strategic proactivity|
|Lead|The sustaining corporation|

### Rejection

- Explicitly try to avoid doing anything for the environment
- Resources are there to be exploited for immediate economic gain
- Other people's concerns don't matter - just want to profit
- Will openly or subtly oppose government and community constrains on operations

### Non-responsiveness

- Lack of awareness of firms impact on environmental factors, and vice-versa
- Environmental consequences are disregarded - no expertise about it in the organisation
- E.g. IT industry in early years regarding climate changes
	- Thought equipment had low impact
	- Thought couldn't do much
	- Now realise that IT has same emissions as Aviation industry

### Compliance

- Meet standards (don't go above) to avoid sanctions
- Primarily reacting to legislation and growing community awareness
- Followers not leaders - only reactive
- Expertise is primarily in the environmental health and safety department

### Eco-efficiency

- Recognise that there can be a 'win-win' - environmental and economic gain - e.g. recycling/selling waste
- Active searching and implenting those, ignore others
- Environmental management system may be introduced (e.g. ISO 14001)
- Expertise is in facilities and operations
