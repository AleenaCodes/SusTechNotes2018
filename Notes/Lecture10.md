## Corporate Sustainability

Companies can do different things to implement their intention around sustainability - Dunphy explores some options

- Keeping your house in order
	- Make your business sustainable
- Reducing the impact of your products
	- Looking at the lifecycles of your products
- Stakeholder engagement
- Research and innovation
- Philanthropy

Many of these will fall in UN goal 12 - responsible consumption and production

### Keeping your own house in order

- Energy reduction and low carbon practices around facilities, offices, travel, transport
- Making sure your workers are physically safe in the workplace
- Waste reduction, low emissions of hazardous substances
- Appropriate management and auditing processes (e.g. ISO 14001)
- Public reporting of performance e.g. through the Carbon Disclosure Project

Most of these have a solid business case - they'll save money!

### Reducing the impact of your products

- Thinking of the implications on the users of the product
- How does the product do damage to the environment - how to engineer to reduce this
- Engaging with the supply chain to reduce environmental impact and ensuring fair work practices
- End-of-life policies and management

### Stakeholder Engagement

- Engaging with employees - harnessing ideas and enthusiasm
- Working with other companies in the sector on joint action
- Engaging with investors and analysts
- Engaging with NGOs and environmental organisations
- Engaging with governments and the public

### Research and Innovation

- There is government funding for sustainability projects - it's an opportunity for businesses to get money
- R&D around how the company's products and services can be used to support a move to a more sustainable world

### Philanthropy

- Many big companies have lots of money that can be invested in philanthropy
- Can help to contribute to the company's broader sustainability strategy
- There is a risk of the 'more attractive' projects getting more funding than those that will necessarily use the money the best

### Leadership and Governance

- Who in the company has the responsibility to look at sustainability?
- This varies between companies
- There can be policy and strategy within a company to decide this

### Transparency and Compliance

- There is slowly more legal reporting requirements around this
- But most reporting is voluntary and most companies do this - helps to provide a good narrative around themselves
- Some companies have these audited to provide more assurance for the report

## Sustainability Reporting

### Global Reporting Initiative

- The GRI standards help us test what a company is *not* reporting
- Each companies report can be checked against the things in the GRI standards to see which areas haven't been talked about

### Software

- There is a lot of software to help with this reporting
- A commonly used one is SoFi - it includes frameworks for GRI, CDP, DJSI, GRESB etc.

### CDP

- An influential carbon reduction program started in the UK in 2000
- Represents 650 investors who manage a huge amount of assets between them - $87 trillion
- Over 6400 reporting companies and 500 cities
- It is in investor's interest to invest in companies who are more sustainable - less risk in the future
- 99 purchasing organsiation use the global CDP system to mitigate environmental risk in their supply chain

### Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reporting scopes

Everything is converted into tons of CO2 equivalent and report where it's coming from

- Scope 1 - basically burning it ourselves
	- e.g. burning gas for heating, or petrol as fuel in cars
	- This is quite easy to measure - there are meters etc.
- Scope 2 - electricity that we buy in
	- i.e. carbon emissision are from the power station as opposed to us
- Scope 3 - everything else
	- Much more difficult to measure as we don't easily have data

Can calculate the cost of the carbon for the business - determines a business case for R&D investments

'Internal Carbon Pricing' is used by companies when making business decisions
