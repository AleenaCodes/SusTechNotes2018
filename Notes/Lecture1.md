- Background reading
	- Optional

### Assessment

- 2 hour exam - 70%
	- Section 1 - short questions on the unit
	- Section 2 - conduct a life cycle analysis of a simple digital system
		- Do problem sheets to understand this
- Coursework - 30%
	- Individual work
	- Mock funding application for a technology project to tackle a sustainability challenge
		- Describe intervention and benefits
		- How would you trial and assess it
		- What are the risks and potential negative consequences
	- Will be drop-in sessions - start early and get feedback
- Problem sheets - 0%
	- Important for second part of the exam
	- Will have drop-in sessions and can submit problem sheets for feedback (but mark yourself first)

## What is Sustainable Development?

### Different Definitions

The idea dates back a while

-  1972 - UN Stockholm Conference on Human Environment
	- Talked about conflict between providing necessities for everyone and the environmental resources to do that
- 1987 - Brundtland Report
	- Can't view the environment as separate from the economic sphere
	- Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations
- 1991 - IUCN/UNEP/WWF
	- Planet ecosystem has a carrying capacity, need to live within that
- George Bush
	- Economic growth that will benefit the present and future generations without affecting the resources and biological systems of the planet
- World Business Council for Sustainable Development
	- Pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental quality and social equity
	- Companies aiming for sustainability need to performa against a 'triple bottom line'
- Inter-faith Center of Corporate Responsibility
	- Producing partnerships with people which empower communities of people to develop themselves effectively

### What needs to be sustained?

Different priorities to different organisations

- Nature
	- Earth
	- Biodiversity
	- Ecosystems
- Life support
	- Ecosystem services
	- Resources
	- Environment
- Community
	- Culture
	- Groups
	- Places

Different philosophical perspectives
- Nature - saving things because of their right to be saved - biodiversity has an intrinsic value
- Life support - saving things because of their value to us as humans
- Community - saving things because their worth saving - 'intrinsic value' - the right for things to be living

Perspectives - Anthropocentric perspective (human) vs Ecocentric perspective (environment) are often debated about

### What should be developed?

- The economy
	- Wealth
	- Productivity
	- Consumption
- People
	- Life expectancy
	- Education
	- Social equity/opportunity
- Society
	- Security and wellbeing of states, institutions
	- Social caapital

Different definition of sustainability will pick different ones of these as a priority

### Chris' Definition

- The planet supplies ecosystem services to us
	- Wind power
	- Solar
	- Breaks down things we put in the ocean
	- etc.
- There's more demand as time goes on for these services
- How can we innovate to have supply match the demand

### Planetary boundaries

- Climate change
- Ozone depletion
	- This was actually managed - success!
- Acidification
- Phosphorus/nitrogen
	- Flows being affected - water systems can't deal with how much coming in
- Freshwater use
	- Strict rules on this
- Land-system change

### Can a company be sustainable?

- Company/product/country are examples of 'open systems'
- Their performance depends on ...
> missed some - 9:39-9:40


## Environmental Challenge from Jared Diamond

3 things
> missed some - 9:40

### Destruction and loss

1. Habitats

[Pic]
Lines in the ocen are caused from trawling across the ocean floor - ocean being damaged by human activities

2. Wild Foods

Overfishing in the UK/Ireland - sole is not readily available anymore

3. Biodiversity

Many animals/plants that are endangered

4. Soil

Problems with soil no longer having previous fertility - loss of fertility being caused by topsoil being washed away over time

### Limits

1. Energy

Likely that oil won't be an issue, but more that using it all will cause climate change issues
Non-renewable sources are incredibly energy expensive - now takes more energy to pump out oil - returns not as high as previously

2. Freshwater

Not an issue globally, but affects some areas - Australia, India etc.

3. Photosynthetic ceiling

> missed some

4. Raw Materials

> missed some

### Harmful Things

1. Generation of toxins

[Pic] - recycling circuit boards - releasing dioxins that are toxic

Partially solved in the west (not entirely, e.g. diesel)
Tend to ship most toxic waste elsewhere in the world

Digital products are the most toxic and most valuable of our products

2. Alien species

Sometimes accidentally move animals/plants around and cause unexpected effects

3. Ozone depleting chemicals

Success story - CFCs have now been phased out

4. Greenhouse gases

CO2, Nitroous oxide, methane
Fluorinated compounds - used in some manufacturing - one unit 10,000 times more powerful in effect on environment (so release less but cause more problems)

## Social Challenges

Sustainable development isn't just an environmental issue

Key political question - to what extent do we share benefits of growth more widely - e.g. in developing countries
