# Lecture 5 - 17/10/18

## Intro

- John Brenton and Chris Jones
- Work on sustainability at the university

## Terminology

- 1 GW - 1 Gigawatt - typical size for a power station
- 1TWh - 1 Terawatt hour - 1 billion kWh
- A 1GW power station running for a year produced 8.760 TWh
- kWH - a 'unit' of electricity costs about 12p delivered
- University uses 68 GWh last year - 0.02% of the UK

## National Grid

- Joins all consumers
- Commercial generation started in 1880
- Centralised into National Grid in 1835 to better match supply and demand
- First commercial nuclear power in 1956
- Peak consumpton was 350TWh in 2004
- Grid peak was 61.5GW in 2007

### What's changed

- Sulphur from power stations was mixing with water and falling as acid rain
	- Combatted by a directive in 2003
- Reducing supplies of North Sea Oil and Gas
- Increasing demand from elsewhere in the world
- Aging infrastructure - things fail over time

## Climate Change

- Pushing boundaries of the climate every year - 'hottest day' etc.
- Can see from statistics that everything is warming up over time
- Correlation between rising CO2 levels and world temperature
- Paris agreement is trying to limit emissions around the world in different sector

### Political Changes - UK

- Energy White Paper - 2003
	- Identified challenges in using the grid
	- Prioritised efficiency and low carbon electricity
- Large Combustion Plante Directive - 2007-2015
	- Control of SO2 - Dirty plants had 8 years to reduce emissions or close
	- Big effect on carbon
- Climate Change Act - 2008
	- Gave legally binding CO2 targets
	- First country to do this

## Cleaner Electricity - The Supply Side

- Cutting demand is the best way to reduce emissions
- Total consumption and peak demand are declining due to various incentives to use at different times e.g. changes in lightbulbs used
- Current planning suggest demand will drop until the mid 2020's then increase from demand of electrification of heating and transport

Sources of electricity - 2017/2018

Can see we're still reliant on gas especially to balance the supply

### Different Technologies for Production

|Technology|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Unabated cleaner fossil fuels|- Dispatchables <br> - Cheap and easy to roll out <br> - Well understood|- Not *that* clean <br> - Don't know cost and availability in the future|
|Nuclear|- Low carbon <br> - Meets baseload - reliable|- Long lead times <br> - Public opinion is poor <br> - Expensive and long time to build <br> - No-one knows how to handle the waste|
|Intermittent renewables - Solar, Wind|- Short lead-in times <br> - Well-understood mature technology <br> - On-short wind is relatively cheap|- Expensive compared to gas but cheaper than nuclear since 2017 <br> - Public opinion is poor - people don't like the look <br> - Take up land <br> - Sometimes has to be stopped because no capacity in the grid|
|Dispatchable renewables - Biomass, Hydropower|- Dispatchable <br> - Short lead-in times <br> - Well understood <br> - Relatively cheap <br> - Role for pumped storage|- Take up a lot of land <br> - At best could have 2% of UK demand from this due to lack of suitable land|
|Carbon capture and storage|- Dispatchable - can use the gas power stations to then meet baseloads and peaks|- Expensive <br> - Unproven and inefficient <br> - Relies on fossil fuels|

No perfect solution - have to balance advantages and disadvantages of each technology

### A Typical Autumn Day

Price changes because of extra demand at certain hours - incentivises people to use it at other times

To meet the demand we would produce like this

## Storage and EV

In places like California there are more variable renewables on the grid so there is a different problem

- Duck Curve (in yellow above)
- Price of electricity can even go to negative when there's lots of solar on the grid and nowhere to put it
	- Incentive for people to look at storage solutions

### The Smart Grid

- Could storage take cheap/better-than-free electricity and store it until the grid peaks
- Could electric vehicles broken the intermittency of renewables by taking from the grid
- We need a smarter grid to control the flow of electricity much better

### Bristol University

- At the university try to run each piece of equipment in sync with the rest of the grid
- Only buy electricity from sustainable sources
- Spend 6.2 million a year on electricity - gas is 2.2 million of that
