## Parts of an LCA (cont.)

### Impact Assessment

- This is the complete process model, quantified and normalised according to reference flow
- This results in a number of quantified elementary flows to and from the environment
- This quantifies the "environmental load" induced by the process
- Impact assessment is the characterisation of the "environmental impact" induced this environmental load
- Different methods are used - chemistry, toxicology, ecology etc.

#### Example - Global Warming Potential

- GWP is an environmental impact resulting from emissions to the air of a number of gases - $CO_2, NH_3, NO, CFCs, SF_6$ and others
- GWP can be assesed in terms of "radiative forcing" - the capacity to absorb infrared radiation - this is an indicator of climate impact
- Units for this would be Watts/metres$^2$ but instead this is normalised to "carbon dioxide equivalent" - how much is a kg of this gas compared to CO$_2$
- GWP can also be 'precompiled' for specific activities from other LCAs
	- These are 'emissions factors' - such as burning petrol, coal, using electricity etc.

#### Other Midpoint Indicators

 There are also other environmental impacts
- Ozone depletion
- Absorbed dose of radiation
- Particulate concentration
- Induced algal growth
- Fresh water hazardous waste concentration
- Land occupation and usage change

There a 'midpoints' and 'endpoints'

- Midpoints are relatively easy to characterise with a low level of uncertainty
	- Not necessarily what we're interested in
	- Want to know what it's impacts are
- Endpoints are less easy to characterise and more uncertain
	- Human health - measured in disability adjusted life years
	- Ecosystem destruction - measured in species/year
	- Resource - measured by surplus cost

Above are midpoints and endpoints, and how they link up

#### Dealing with the Future

- There is uncertainty about the future and also moral factors
- There are 3 ways of thinking about the future
	- Individualist - want short-term solutions that help current people - a bit optimistic about science and how future generations will cope
	- Hierarchist - roughly the EU perspective - think about impacts holistically 
	- Egalitarian - long-term solutions, pessimistic about science - thinks of worst case

#### Perspectives and Climate Change

- Individualist
	- GWP$_20$
	- Low increase in natural disasters
	- Humans will adapt to temperature
	- Flood defenses will be put in place
	- Species will disperse around climate change
- Hierarchist
	- GWP$_100$
	- Mean increase in natural disasters
	- Some human adaptation to reduce malnutrition and temperature stress
- Egalitarian
	- GWP$_500$
	- Increase in natural disasters at the upper bound
	- No adaptation so full impact of malnutrition/stress
	- No species dispersal
	- Considers many future generations

A lot of subjective judgement in these

### Interpretations

- Have to be honest about how robust your analysis is
- Results should be validated and should have a 'reality check'
- Perform robust analysis against expected outcomes to identify obvious errors
	- Sanity check
	- Completeness
	- Uncertainty
- Identify sensitivities and major contributing factors - where are the biggest emissions?

#### Robustness Analysis and Uncertainty

- Completeness - have you covered all processes in inventory and assessment?
- Consistency - does it align with the goal and scope?
- Uncertainty - how large is the potential error in process data
- Sensitivity - how is the result influenced from your assumptions
- Variation - how will the process model change from assumptions
- Data quality - check for gaps, is the data appropriate

##### Uncertainty

There are two types of uncertainty

- Aleatory/stochastic uncertainty - genuine variation in the system
	- Variation in user behaviour
	- Variation in supply source
	- Geographic variation
	- Inherent randomness in the process
- Epistemic uncertainty - resulting from a lack of knowledge
	- Measurement accuracy
	- Expert disagreement
	- Lack of knowledge about distribution of variation

##### Sensitivity Analysis

- Systematically vary parameters to assess their influence on the result
- The Monte Carlo method can be used to 'draw' data parameter values from a range, and then measure the distribution of the resulting impact assessment
- The Spearman Rank can be used to calculate the relative impacts of variation of different variables in the model

#### Answering the Question

- After all the analysis, need to go back and answer the original question
- Could be simple - "what is the carbon footprint", or more complicated "which R&D option should we choose"
