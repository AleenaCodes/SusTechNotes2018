# Lecture 12 - 9/11/18

## Intro

- There is a big disconnect between the consumers and the supply chains for electronics - most people don't know where things in their devices actually come from e.g. the metals etc.
- The electronic supply chains can also be very complicated, meaning companies lose control of where their materials are sourced from
	- In the 1980's electronics companies began to outsource their manufacturing and assembly in order to take advantage of cheaper labour costs
- These two things coupled result in many high-profile cases of malpractice in factories, child labour etc.
- There is a rising consumer awareness nowadays so companies are getting more focussed on their supply chains
	- Started with NGOs mainly concentrating on shoes and clothes, but expanded to other industries
- From 2000, companies started to place expectations on suppliers - enforcing paperwork that ensures certain standards
	- However, these varied between different brands and so suppliers didn't necessarily take these very seriously
	- The Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) CoC was launched in 2004 to address this

## EICC/RBA

The Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (now renamed the Responsible Business Alliance) covers 5 areas -

- Labour
- Health and Safety
- Environment
- Ethics
- Management Systems

> Required reading - the [EICC Code of Conduct](http://www.responsiblebusiness.org/standards/code-of-conduct)

### Audit Approach

The process for RBA auditing is as follows

- CMA - Customer Managed Audit
	- Self-audit - can't be give site level recognition with just this 
- VAP - Validated Audit Process
	- Need this for site level recognition

A validated audit process must include

### Criticisms of the RBA

- Members only need to demonstrate 'working towards'  - not that hard to get accredited
- CoC is quite vague about collective bargaining
- Can go through without independent verification
	- Although there is an incentive for it - doing so gives more assurance to other brand owners to place their manufacturing process with you
- Audits don't have to be made public - from an NGO perspective the process is not very transparent
- Early versions of the code could be viewed as quite having quite a colonial view of the world - didn't involve people who had to implement the code in the creation of it

### RBA and Wages

- Wage must 'comply with all applicable wage laws'
- A bit of a weak approach - only requires minimum wage as opposed to enforcing a living wage
- Can be construed as condoning exploitation of workers

## An Economic Perspective

- Creating and enforcing a code of conduct costs -
	- Enforcement requires manpower which costs money
	- Enforcement can increase the cost of your supplier - they have to put measures into place that cost them money
- So from a 'rational economic' perspective, companies have to make a tradeoff in terms of how much to invest in enforcement of such codes
- NGOs try to increase the cost of non-enforcement by bringing in consumer pressure so that companies are willing to invest more

### Case Study - Apple and Foxconn

- Foxconn is a major of supplier for Apple and other electronics companies
- It employs around 800,000 people (compared to Apple's 130,000)
- There's been a lot of press around it recently
- In 2012 there was a worker riot, by 2014 there was a big change and Greenpeace praised the supply chain transparency
- It did, however mean that costs went up and it couldn't compete with other manufacturers - driven to automate more processes to bring costs down again

### Considerations

- It's important to remember that not all rules can be applied to a situation - have to consider things case-by-case
- e.g. in China workers can be 'internal migrants' - they might rather work longer hours and get back to their families faster
