# Lecture 9 - 31/10/18

- Smarter2030 was a report covering IT solutions for sustainability
- We previously covered the Dunpy sustainability model

## Strategic Proactivity

- This is acting sustainably for business advantages
- This can be for money, or for good PR

## Sectoral Action

- We'll look at an example of sectoral action, at an organisation called Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI)
- This is a trade body which has think tanks to produce reports around how IT can support better sustainability
- Having this sort of collective action reduces 'first move disadvantage' and places collective pressure on suppliers

Companies that are close to being a 'sustaining corporation' can use sectoral initiatives to identify and overcome barriers

## IT and Sustainability

- ICT and Engineering companies argue that their technologies can be used to reduce GHG emisions
- This is an example of strategic proactivity
	- IBM 'Smarter Planet'
	- Philips 'Better Me, Better World'
	- Huawei 'Green World'
	- SONG 'Road to Zero'
	- O2 'Think Big'
	- CISCO 'EnergyWise'

Why are these companies launching these initiatives?

- Helps to take the heat off their direct impact
	- ICT is responsible for 2-4% of global emissions - as much as the aviation industry!
- It provides good PR for the company to the general public and to governments
- It encourages investment in research by the government
- It makes money - 
	- Energy is getting more expensive over time
	- Innovative products can be sold

The 'Greening with IT' agenda wants to quantify (and hence monetise on carbon markets) emissions reductions from IT.

> Could be worth reading the SMARTer2030 report - it is available online

- E-learning solutions such as online platforms
- Reduces travel to physical locations
- Potential - 0.1Gt CO2 a year

### Abatement Costs

- However the cost of these reductions can be very high
- There are cheaper solutions that should probably be done first
	- Solid wall insulation
	- Wind turbines

### Methodology

- This report is consultancy-style - doesn't dig deep into the numbers in terms of margins etc.
- It took 9 representative countires and calculated the drivers of 'addressable emissions'
- Then they estimated a savings potential for the technology, by looking at
	- The efficiency improvement estimate for the technology
	- An estimate for the adoption of that technology by 2030
- This was then extrapolated to calculate global impact

The report recognises, but doesn't quantify, a range of uncertainty -

- The input data
- The adoption rate
- The technology impact

The ICT's don't include everything so probably underestimate impact a bit

- Include PC's, tablets, smartphones, mobiles, 3D printers
- Exclude TV's and printers

## IT for  *Un*sustainability

The SMARTer2030 report paints a very rose picture of IT, but there are many aspects of it that promote unsustainability

- Short hardware replacement cycles
- Built in obselescence
- Hindering the 'right to repair'
- Externalising costs - supply chain responsibility, social impct
- Intergenerational injustice/inequitable access
- Digital threat to democracy
- AI trained on prejudiced data sets

The 'move fast and break things' mentality can be detrimental

IT has a real role to play in the transition to a low-carbon society, but it is important to consider all aspects around innovation and realise that IT will have to work in conjunction with many other things - economics and policies
