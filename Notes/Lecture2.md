## Worldviews and the Environment

- Different people have different views on the environment
- These are called *discourses*
- People with different discourses may agree on certain things but use different languages so miss each other
- If you want to create change, it is useful to understand the language of different people and their motivations

## Dryzek's Model

A model of how people engage with the environment

||Reformist|Radical|
|:---|---|---:|
|Prosaic|Problem solving|Survivalism|
|Imaginative|Sustainability|Green Radicalism|

Two aspects -
- Attitude to the current political system
	- Reformist - system needs a reform
	- Radical - system needs to be replaced
- Attitude to environmental problems
	- Prosaic - unmitigatingly bad and just need to get on with it
	- Imaginative - opportunity to create change that has even more impact than the environment

### Denial - Promethean response

The idea that there is no real problem

Two responses -

- Denial that there's a problem
	- e.g. climate change doesn't exist
- Believing that the problem exists, but market forces will naturally sort out what problems there are
	- Society will recognise that there is a challenge and then pay for it to be solved
	- e.g. depletion of resources will result in price rises - encouraging search for alternative materials
	- True in a sense, economic forces will naturally make companies invest in cheaper solutions as prices rise, and find solutions to upcomings problems
	- But doesn't work for climate change - feedback is decades, so economic forces will be very delayed

### Prosaic and Reformist: Problem Solving Discourse

- Focus on solving well-bounded environmental problems
- Solve these within the socioeconomic system as it is

#### Administrative Rationalism

- Around in western countries since 1970's, and in the 2000's in the east
- Experts decide what level of environmental impact is appropriate from a public interest perspective
	- e.g. how much waste can we pump into the sea
- Administrators put measures in place to enact this
	- e.g. cap on how much waste you can put out, then fined after that
- Use combination of environmental impact assessments and cost-benefit analysis to work this out
- Laws such as *BATNEEC* - Best Available Technology Not Exceeding Excessive Cost
- Results in a rhetoric of 'concern and reassurance'
- Not good at dealing with problems that can't be centralised or which cross boundaries
	- Doesn't encourage innovation - government tells people what to do
- Suffers from *Implementation Deficit*
	- Laws get passed but not enforced
- Companies don't necessarily agree with the laws - haven't been involved in the making so there doesn't tend to be a critical mass of companies that don't try to find ways around it

#### Democratic Pragmatism

- Scientist suggestions don't always create ideas that work well in society
- Public consultation - involving civic society in decisions
	- Results in more democratic legitimacy
	- In an ideal world produces a consensus that can be rolled out
- Results in a mix of cooperation and competition between stakeholders
- But can get co-opted by those with more money - 'coopted by the powerful'

#### Economic Rationalism

- Idea - environmental problems are a result of market failure, due to
	- Externalities - making a trade tends to be in the interest of both parties, but can impact people outside of it (either positively or negatively)
	- The tragedy of commons
- The capitalist system doesn't provide price signals for the environmental challenges that we face
- Approach - the most effective way to manage environmental problems is to 
	- Define how much externalities someone can do and place a cap on this
		- e.g. emit a certain quantity of CO2
		- Creates a market to buy and sell rights
		- Encourages innovation to profit from selling these rights
- The key idea is that humanity is made up of rational self-interested economic actors - it's the government's role to create frameworks to encourage them to do the right things - incentive for companies to tackle issue for financial gain
- Some people don't like environmentals problem being reduced to an economic challenge

### Prosaic and Radical: Survivalism

- Big in the 1970's
- There are inevitable limits to growth of humanity - carrying capacity of the biosphere
- Can't contain this within the current economy - too much freedom
- We need to move to a more benign authoritarian approach - coordinated action by political elites is needed - e.g. one-child policy in China
- Must move to a steady-state economy - resource use, population and economic development must be limited
- If we don't, ecosystem service will degrade

#### Survivalist Discourse

- Uses metaphors from ecosystem population dynamics - 'planet Earth is a spaceship - with limits etc.'
- Images of doom - apocalyptic model of environmental problems
- Sees humanity as selfish people that need to be told what to do - actions as having to come from elites in power
- Largely rejected now due to the authoritarian approach, but the technical analysis has had a strong impact on global discourse - the notion of environmental limits persists

### Imaginative and Reformist: Sustainability

- Can we accept ecological limits but allow lives to move on (especially in developing countries) and allow people to engage with things through technical innovation

#### Sustainable Development

- Economic growth in developing countries is necessary to allow poorer people to 'catch up' with the West
- Growth should be promoted -
	-  Poverty is a source of environmental degredation - e.g. deforestation,use of non-renwable sources for light etc.
	- But growth should be guided to be environmentally benign and socially just
- Economic growth, environmental protection, distributive justice and long-term sustainability can be done at the same time, and be mutually reinforcing
- Cooperation at global and local levels is key
- Language - 'reassurance' and 'progress'

#### Ecological Modernisation

- Need to have a way of living to keep quality of life but reduce environmental impact
- Restructuring of capitalist economy on more environmentally sound lines
- Not possible purely from the free market, but if encouraged it will be effective in moving society in the direction we want to go
- Conscious intervention is needed
- Governments should create opportunities for business - private sector will make money so won't resist a transformation
- The state is the leader, but others need to buy in
- Language - 'reassurance' and 'opportunity'
- This is the approach that has had the most positive impact so far - people have adopted in lots of places, and political parties have agreed
